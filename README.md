# rock-paper-scissors

 - The rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreed-upon time. 
 - The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game.
 - rock > scissors , paper > rock, scissors > paper. 
 - If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied.
